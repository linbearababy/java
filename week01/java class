# JAVA: INTRODUCTION TO CLASSES
Introduction to Classes
All programs require one or more classes that act as a model for the world.

For example, a program to track student test scores might have Student, Course, and Grade classes. Our real-world concerns, students and their grades, are inside the program as classes.

We represent each student as an instance, or object, of the Student class.

This is object-oriented programming because programs are built around objects and their interactions. An object contains state and behavior.

Classes are a blueprint for objects. Blueprints detail the general structure. For example, all students have an ID, all courses can enroll a student, etc.

An instance is the thing itself. This student has an ID of 42, this course enrolled that student, etc.

Let’s review with another example, a savings account at a bank.

What should a savings account know?

The balance of money available.
What should a savings account do?

Deposit money.
Withdraw money.

Imagine two people have accounts that are instances of the SavingsAccount class. They share behavior (how they deposit and withdraw) but have individual state (their balances), and even with the same balance amount these accounts are separate entities.

Instructions
Our text editor contains a complete class definition that we’ll build up as we progress through the lesson.

    public class Store {
      // instance fields
      String productType;
      int inventoryCount;
      double inventoryPrice;

      // constructor method
      public Store(String product, int count, double price) {
        productType = product;
        inventoryCount = count;
        inventoryPrice = price;
      }

      // main method
      public static void main(String[] args) {
        Store lemonadeStand = new Store("lemonade", 42, .99);
        Store cookieShop = new Store("cookies", 12, 3.75);

        System.out.println("Our first shop sells " + lemonadeStand.productType + " at " + lemonadeStand.inventoryPrice + " per unit.");

        System.out.println("Our second shop has " + cookieShop.inventoryCount + " units remaining.");
      }
    }
    
# Classes: Syntax
The fundamental concept of object-oriented programming is the class.

A class is the set of instructions that describe how an instance can behave and what information it contains.

Java has pre-defined classes such as System, which we’ve used in logging text to our screen, but we also need to write our own classes for the custom needs of a program.

Here’s a definition of a Java class:

public class Car {
// scope of Car class starts after curly brace

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // scope of main() starts after curly brace

    // program tasks

  }
  // scope of main() ends after curly brace

}
// scope of Car class ends after curly brace
This example defines a class named Car. public is an access level modifier that allows other classes to interact with this class. For now, all classes will be public.

This class has a main() method, which lists the tasks performed by the program. main() runs when we execute the compiled Car.class file.
