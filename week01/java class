# JAVA: INTRODUCTION TO CLASSES
Introduction to Classes
All programs require one or more classes that act as a model for the world.

For example, a program to track student test scores might have Student, Course, and Grade classes. Our real-world concerns, students and their grades, are inside the program as classes.

We represent each student as an instance, or object, of the Student class.

This is object-oriented programming because programs are built around objects and their interactions. An object contains state and behavior.

Classes are a blueprint for objects. Blueprints detail the general structure. For example, all students have an ID, all courses can enroll a student, etc.

An instance is the thing itself. This student has an ID of 42, this course enrolled that student, etc.

Let’s review with another example, a savings account at a bank.

What should a savings account know?

The balance of money available.
What should a savings account do?

Deposit money.
Withdraw money.

Imagine two people have accounts that are instances of the SavingsAccount class. They share behavior (how they deposit and withdraw) but have individual state (their balances), and even with the same balance amount these accounts are separate entities.

    public class Store {
      // instance fields
      String productType;
      int inventoryCount;
      double inventoryPrice;

      // constructor method
      public Store(String product, int count, double price) {
        productType = product;
        inventoryCount = count;
        inventoryPrice = price;
      }

      // main method
      public static void main(String[] args) {
        Store lemonadeStand = new Store("lemonade", 42, .99);
        Store cookieShop = new Store("cookies", 12, 3.75);

        System.out.println("Our first shop sells " + lemonadeStand.productType + " at " + lemonadeStand.inventoryPrice + " per unit.");

        System.out.println("Our second shop has " + cookieShop.inventoryCount + " units remaining.");
      }
    }
    
# Classes: Syntax
The fundamental concept of object-oriented programming is the class.

A class is the set of instructions that describe how an instance can behave and what information it contains.

Java has pre-defined classes such as System, which we’ve used in logging text to our screen, but we also need to write our own classes for the custom needs of a program.

Here’s a definition of a Java class:

        public class Car {
        // scope of Car class starts after curly brace

          public static void main(String[] args) {
            // scope of main() starts after curly brace

            // program tasks

          }
          // scope of main() ends after curly brace

        }
        // scope of Car class ends after curly brace
This example defines a class named Car. public is an access level modifier that allows other classes to interact with this class. For now, all classes will be public.

This class has a main() method, which lists the tasks performed by the program. main() runs when we execute the compiled Car.class file.

                public class Store {
                  public static void main(String[] args) {

                  }

                }
        
# Classes: Constructors
We create objects (instances of a class) using a constructor method. The constructor is defined within the class.

Here’s the Car class with a constructor:

        public class Car {
          public Car() {
          //constructor method starts after curly brace

            //instructions for creating a Car instance

          }
          //constructor method ends after curly brace

          public static void main(String[] args) {

            // program tasks

          }
        }
The constructor, Car(), shares a name with the class.

We create instances by calling or invoking the constructor within main(). This example assigns an instance to the variable ferrari:

        public class Car {

          public Car() {
          }

          public static void main(String[] args) {
            /*
            invoke a constructor using 
            'new', the name, and parentheses:
            new Car()
            */
            Car ferrari = new Car(); 
          }
}
As with other variable declarations, we specify the type: Car, and name: ferrari. Variables that reference an instance have a type of the class name.

We invoke the constructor method: Car(), and use the keyword new to indicate that we’re creating an instance. Omitting new causes an error.

This is the first time we’ve called a method that we’ve also defined. main() is run automatically and we did not define the println() method.

Introducing a second method is a big step in your programming journey, congratulations!


Instructions
1.
Let’s explore how code execution moves around the file with two methods.

Add a print statement inside our Store constructor with the message: I am inside the constructor method.

We’ll see this message whenever we create an instance of Store by calling the constructor.

We print messages using System.out.println(). Here’s an example printing the message Making a shoe!

        System.out.println("Making a shoe!");
Make sure you’re placing the print statement inside the curly braces of the Store() constructor method!

2.
We did not see our constructor message printed because we haven’t run the code inside the constructor.

Inside main(), create an instance of Store called lemonadeStand. Don’t forget the new keyword!

We should see the constructor message.

We create instances of a class by using the new keyword and invoking the constructor.

For example, say we had a Dog class.

    public Dog {
      public Dog() {
        // body of Dog constructor method
      }
      public static void main(String[] args) {
        // declare variable type and name
        Dog fido;
        // assign a new instance of Dog to fido
        fido = new Dog();
      }
    }
We’ll often consolidate declaration and assignment into a single line:

Dog fido = new Dog();
3.
Inside main(), print lemonadeStand to see how Java represents this instance.

Review the order of the printed messages:

Running the program invokes main()
We create an instance so we move from main() to Store()
The code inside Store() runs
When Store() finishes execution, we return to main()
When printing a variable, do not use double quotes.

Here’s how to print the variable fido:

System.out.println(fido);

public class Store {
  
  // new method: constructor!
  
  # example
  
          public Store() {
                System.out.println("I am inside the constructor method.");
          }

          // main method is where we create instances!
          public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println("Start of the main method.");

            // create the instance below
            Store lemonadeStand;
            lemonadeStand = new Store();

            // print the instance below
             System.out.println(lemonadeStand);
          }
        }
        
        
        
        output 
        
        Start of the main method.
        I am inside the constructor method.
