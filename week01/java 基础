# main() Method in Java

    public class Person {

      public static void main(String[] args) {

        System.out.println("Hello, world!");

      }

    }
In Java, every application must contain a main() method, which is the entry point for the application. All other methods are invoked from the main() method.

The signature of the method is public static void main(String[] args) { }. It accepts a single argument: an array of elements of type String.

# Java Classes

public class Person {
  
  int age;
  
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    
    // p and p1 are objects of the Person class
    Person p1 = new Person();
    Person p2 = new Person();
    p1.age = 20;
    p2.age = 30;
    
  }
  
}
In Java, a class is used as a blueprint to create objects. Each object made from a class is an individual entity.

A Java program must have one class whose name is the same as the program filename.

In the example, the Person class must be declared in a program file named Person.java.

# Compiling in Java

 Compile the class file:
javac first.java

# Execute the compiled file:
java first
In Java, when we compile a program, each individual class is converted into a .class file, which is known as byte code.

The JVM (Java virtual machine) is used to run the byte code.
