#Introduction

This book teaches programming using Java. Java is a powerful language that runs on practically every type of computer. It can be used to create large applications or small programs
that are part of a Web site. Before plunging right into learning Java, however, this chapter
will review the fundamentals of computer hardware and software, and then take a broad
look at computer programming in general.

# Why Program?

Concept: Computers can do many different jobs because they are programmable.
Every profession has tools that make the job easier to do. Carpenters use hammers, saws,
and measuring tapes. Mechanics use wrenches, screwdrivers, and ratchets. Electronics technicians use probes, scopes, and meters. Some tools are unique and can be categorized as
belonging to a single profession. For example, surgeons have certain tools that are designed
specifically for surgical operations. Those tools probably aren’t used by anyone other than
surgeons. There are some tools, however, that are used in several professions. Screwdrivers,
for instance, are used by mechanics, carpenters, and many others.
The computer is a tool used by so many professions that it cannot be easily categorized. It
can perform so many different jobs that it is perhaps the most versatile tool ever made. To the
accountant, computers balance books, analyze profits and losses, and prepare tax reports.
To the factory worker, computers control manufacturing machines and track production.
To the mechanic, computers analyze the various systems in an automobile and pinpoint
hard-to-find problems. The computer can do such a wide variety of tasks because it can

be programmed. It is a machine specifically designed to follow instructions. Because of the
computer’s programmability, it doesn’t belong to any single profession. Computers are
designed to do whatever job their programs, or software, tell them to do.
Computer programmers do a very important job. They create software that transforms
computers into the specialized tools of many trades. Without programmers, the users of
computers would have no software, and without software, computers would not be able to
do anything.
Computer programming is both an art and a science. It is an art because every aspect of a
program should be carefully designed. Here are a few of the things that must be designed
for any real-world computer program:
  •	 The logical flow of the instructions
  •	 The mathematical procedures
  •	 The layout of the programming statements
  •	 The appearance of the screens
  •	 The way information is presented to the user
  •	 The program’s “user friendliness”
  •	 Manuals, help systems, and/or other forms of written documentation
There is also a science to programming. Because programs rarely work right the first time
they are written, a lot of analyzing, experimenting, correcting, and redesigning is required.
This demands patience and persistence of the programmer. Writing software demands discipline as well. Programmers must learn special languages such as Java because computers do
not understand English or other human languages. Programming languages have strict rules
that must be carefully followed.
Both the artistic and scientific nature of programming makes writing computer software
like designing a car: Both cars and programs should be functional, efficient, powerful, easy
to use, and pleasing to look at.
