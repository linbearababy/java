Recursion
Sliding window
Greedy + Backtracking
If you can solve them quickly, you would have a high chance to pass coding interview. Problems are either Easy or Medium. I put these questions in Google Spreadsheet. Feel free to copy and paste to keep track of the progress.
These problems are also available on LeetCode List. You can clone to your account to avoid solving problems you have already solved.

Summary
If you complete all questions and looking for more problem sets, I recommend checking out Algorithm Questions. They also summarize LeetCode problems by category.
If you finish Algorithm Questions too, check out Algorithms and Coding Interviews. My friend is writing it, and itâ€™s worth to read. It provides more detail explanation and general approaches to the problems.
I mentioned these links in the middle of the stories, but here are links to keep track of your progress. Feel free to use them!
